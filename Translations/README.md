__HLOA -> Language

Create documentation of translations first and foremost by constructs. This way, we can determine if we may support all lanaguages or not (i.e., before implementation).

Directories with "_Only" will include language-specific implementations. These folders will only be searched by a tokenizer if the file being translated has the correct extension (e.g., .cpp, .c, .java, .py).
