Is there an incentive for businesses with this technology?
--------------------------------------------
(*) See "Why make a multi-transpiler?.txt" for a more complete and general incentive list.
    
    The incentives for business are as follows:
    - Pay less in training (materials, classes, certificates, etc.) for programmers to learn a new language,
      so you can have a ___(e.g., Java) application.
    - Reduce the time it takes for an application to  be completed in by reduced syntax.
    - Create more interdepartmental knowledge of products by, quite literally, "speaking the same language".
    - (To be added later)
