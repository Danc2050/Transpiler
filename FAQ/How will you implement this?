How will you implement this?
----------------------------

(*) The implementation details will be finalized upon covering 90-100% of the translations from languages.
    The reason is to uncomplicate the process. If I were to mix translation, with implentation, I foresee
    potential problems arising. Depending on how I end up translating, implementation may change and I will
    have to undo a body of work. Therefore, I want to separate the process and be sure of the translation 
    before I end up building the implementation.
    
    However, I still have some ideas for translation. For example:
    - Tokenizers with Abstract Syntax Tree (AST): We may tokenize a file and send tokens through an AST. In fact,
      there may be multiple ASts as this makes for quicker search (e.g., if working in a .cpp file, we do not need
      to include .py translations).
